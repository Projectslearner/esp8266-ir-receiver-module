# ESP8266 IR Receiver Module Project

#### Project Overview
The ESP8266 IR Receiver Module project showcases how to integrate an IR receiver module with an ESP8266 microcontroller to decode and interpret infrared signals from remote controls or other IR sources. The IR receiver captures incoming infrared signals, decodes them, and outputs the decoded information including the IR code, protocol, and bit details to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **IR Receiver Module (e.g., TSOP38238)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the IR Receiver Module:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266.
   - **VCC:** Connect to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266, based on the IR receiver module's voltage requirement.
   - **GND:** Connect to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the decoded IR signals.

2. **Testing:**
   - Aim an IR remote control towards the IR receiver module.
   - Press buttons on the remote to send IR signals.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for the decoded IR code, protocol type, and bit details.

#### Applications
- **Remote Control Integration:** Use in projects requiring remote control functionality.
- **Home Automation:** Integrate with home automation systems for IR-based control of devices.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Implement in consumer electronics for IR remote functionality.

#### Notes
- **IR Signal Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility between the IR receiver module and IR remote control frequencies.
- **Signal Interference:** Minimize interference from ambient light sources for accurate IR signal reception.
- **IR Library Usage:** Explore additional features and functionalities of the IRremoteESP8266 library for advanced IR applications.
